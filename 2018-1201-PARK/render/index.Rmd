In December 2018, Jeremy asked us to look into the tuition model and make some predictions about implementation and sustainability of the program in a way that can meet future cash flow needs.  

This analysis is based on data collected by Carol Hasegawa on tuition ranges and rates.
It would be significantly improved by 

1. specific data on actual tuition charged and received
2. etc.
