I am a mathematical statistician evolving slowly into a cancer researcher.  Driven by data, we use statistical and computational models to learn new things about cancer.  In 2017, we started a small "wet lab" to test our dry bench predictions. 

My research group collaborates across clinical and translational fields attempting to use data to learn more about cancer.  Our primary fields of experience are molecular genomics and immunotherapy. 

Currently, I am an Associate Professor of Oncology at [Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center](https://www.roswellpark.org) in the Department of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics. I earned my MS and PhD from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.stat.wisc.edu) and cross-trained in [medical informatics and computation](http://www.cibm.wisc.edu) as a postdoc. I recently completed a [K01 award in Biomedical Informatics](https://projectreporter.nih.gov/project_info_description.cfm?projectnumber=5K01LM012100-03).
